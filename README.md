# Anki-AI Flashcard Generator

This is the first commit of a personal project to create a Java/Python app that can:

- Accept PDF documents, pasted text, web links and potentially other formats of data
- Extract, parse, and prepare the content for a large language model (LLM)
- Eventually generate **Anki-style flashcards** to help users learn from any content

This repo contains the current source code.

## Features (Milestone 1)

- [ ] Upload PDF documents  
- [ ] Paste and submit raw text  
- [ ] Simple HTML form (Thymeleaf)  
- [ ] Basic controller to handle inputs  
- [ ] Python microservice for parsing (coming next)

One of my endgoals is to have anyone be able to run this on their local machines, using their LLM API of choice (local or not) and manage big knowledge-gardens of Anki cards for fast learning and relearning.
