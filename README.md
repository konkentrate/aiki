# Anki-AI Flashcard Generator

This is the first commit of a personal project to create a Java/Python app that can:

- Accept PDF documents, pasted text, web links and potentially other formats of data
- Extract, parse, and prepare the content for a large language model (LLM)
- Eventually generate **Anki-style flashcards** to help users learn from any content

This repo contains the current source code.
