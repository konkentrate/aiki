# Anki-AI Flashcard Generator

This is the first commit of a personal project to create a Java/Python app that can:

- Accept PDF documents, pasted text, web links and potentially other formats of data
- Extract, parse, and prepare the content for a large language model (LLM)
- Eventually generate **Anki-style flashcards** to help users learn from any content

This repo contains the current source code.

## Features (Milestone 1)
 
- [ ] Paste and submit raw text  
- [ ] Simple HTML form (Thymeleaf)  
- [ ] Python API for Mistral (raw text -> JSON Anki card)

## Milestone 2
- [ ] OCR PDF documents / scans into raw text for processing
- [ ] Way to save card decks usinng categories / tags

One of my endgoals is to have anyone be able to run this on their local machines, using their LLM API of choice (local or not) and manage big knowledge-gardens of Anki cards for fast learning and relearning.
